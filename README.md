Goal: 
single direction, reactive state flow

- "store" object as singleton?

/**
 * Finite State Machine Specs:
 * [x] Each state can define actions that occur when a machine enters or exits that state. Actions will typically have side effects.
 * [x] One state is defined as the initial state. When a machine starts to execute, it automatically enters this state.
 * [x] Each state can define actions that occur when a machine enters or exits that state. Actions will typically have side effects.
 * [x] Each state can define events that trigger a transition.
 * [x] A transition defines how a machine would react to the event, by exiting one state and entering another state.
 * [x] A transition can define actions that occur when the transition happens. Actions will typically have side effects.

>> For me, using a state machine means asking the right questions. This approach simply leads to higher level of predictability. We see how the state machine pattern protects our app being in a wrong state or state that we donâ€™t know about. There is no conditional logic in the view layer because the machine is capable of providing information of what should be rendered.
